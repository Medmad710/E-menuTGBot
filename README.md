  This project worked as an online menu in a coffee shop of a friend who asked me to write the code. 
  In general, nothing special wrote the code for the bot on Aiogram after linking it to the database, 
  made containers on Docker and deployed to the server. 
  It would be more correct to use several files with code and asynchronous functions, but there was no desire at all and it was not bad for mvp
